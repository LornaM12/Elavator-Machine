# Elavtor-Machine

In my case, the elavator has 9 floors, and the different doors ie A,B and C all open to different floors.

Door A starts from ground floor and opens at each floor.

Door B starts from ground floor and only opens in 1,2,3,and 4 floor.

Door C starts from ground floor and only opens on 5,6,7 and 8 floor.
